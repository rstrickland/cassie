* upgrade to util 1.12.7
* upgrade to finagle 1.9.10

# 0.17.0
* update to latest finagle, etc.
* switch tracers to factories

# 0.16.4
* ?

# 0.16.3
* fixed a bug in SuperCounterColumnFamilyBatchMutationBuilder where we weren't actually doing anything, ever.

# 0.16.2
* add a zero-arg constructor to ColumnFamily so that kyle can mock it in his tests

# 0.16.1
* fix multigetslice for FakeCassandra

# 0.16.0
* add multigetRowSlice for regular super column families

# 0.15.0
* fix Utf8Codec. If you are using the current codec, you may need to use LegacyUtf8Codec for compatibility with your stored data.
* fix getRowSlice for regular super column familes (ignored start/end column, order and size)

# 0.14.0
* SuperCounterColumnFamily was added
* regular super column families were also added

# 0.13.0
* upgrade to finagle 1.8.4
* integrated serversets into cassie as a seperate project (cassie-serversets)
    ServerSetsCluster is introduced for discovering hosts via serversets
    Changes in the API include: mapHostsEvery() method moved from Keyspace class to Cluster class
* high level latency and failure counts reported for underlying Cassandra thrift calls:
    set a StatsReceiver when instantiating a Cluster to collect the stats

# 0.11.0
* improved iteration (see RowsIteratee or ColumnsIteratee for examples)
* improved cluster remapping
* separate retry policies for counters and cluster remapping

# 0.10.2
* fix bug where ColumnFamily#columnIteratee might never finish

# 0.10.1
* upgrade to finagle 1.7.1

# 0.10.0
* no more implicits for codecs
* removed redundant codecs. going forward we'll use one codec per datatype.
    This means instead of VarLong and FixedLong we just have Long (and its
    encoded fixed)
* update to new thrift IDL for counters (should be backwards compat if you 
    don't use counters)
* make it possible to iterate over the columns in a row (by @iano)
* make it possible to pass in a tracer
* retry on more than just WriteError's
* update to StandardProject 0.12.7 and sbt-thrift 1.4.4
* update to util 1.10.1
* better exception handling in ColumnFamily

# 0.9.4

# 0.9.3
* upgrade util-core dependency

# 0.9.2
* upgrade to finagle 1.6.1

# 0.9.1
* upgrade to finagle 1.5.3

# 0.9.0
* switch from Option[StatsReceiver] to NullStatsReceiver as an optional parameter
* improvements to the cassie reducer

# 0.8.0
* upgrade to finagle 1.5.1

# 0.7.3
* fix bug in StatsReceiver implementation

# 0.7.2
* update util to 1.8.12

# 0.7.1
* make the finagle stats receiver configurable
* fix heterogenous batches [kyle]
* upgrade to finagle 1.4.3

# 0.7.0
* Add FakeCassandra for testing cassie-based apps

# 0.6.2
* lots of scaladoc
* some minor interface changes (caused by documenting the code)
* add EachQuorum and LocalQuorum consistency levels
* README update
* made the methods for overriding typing on CF private. if you want to use a different type, copy the CF instance
* added ability for batch mutations across column families

# 0.5.3
* assorted fixes to build/publishing

# 0.5.2
* fix bug in remapping clusters

# 0.5.1
* replace dependency on util with util-core (robey)

# 0.5.0
* you can now set a connection timeout
* support for counter column families
* clocks are no longer configurable. everyone gets MicrosecondEpochClock
* fix bug where timer thread wouldn't shut down
* better error handling when re-mapping clusters
* better testing around encoding ints and longs
* ostrich4 support
* an api for deletions at a given timestamp (good for backfilling)
* moved to subprojects
* basic hadoop output support

# 0.3.0 [2011-03-04]
